# Dynamic_Path_Finder
This Python project is a pathfinding visualizer built using Pygame. It implements Dijkstra's Algorithm to find and display the shortest path between two points on a grid. Users can interactively set start and end points, with the algorithm dynamically calculating and highlighting the optimal path around obstacles.
